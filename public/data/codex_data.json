The most critical phonological feature is vowel length; many words are distinguished only by whether a vowel is long (e.g., 'mālum' - apple) or short (e.g., 'malum' - evil). This distinction, often unmarked in texts, is crucial for poetry and correct pronunciation. Consonants like C and G were always hard (like in 'cat' and 'go').",

Umlaut (or mutation) is a historical sound change where a vowel in a root word changes to be more like a vowel in the suffix.

Vowels are divided into back (a, o, u) and front (ä, ö, y) categories; a word stem containing back vowels can only take suffixes with back vowels, and vice-versa. Consonant Gradation is a mutation of plosive consonants (k, p, t) in the stem, which alternate between a 'strong' and 'weak' grade depending on the syllable structure, which is usually affected by the addition of a suffix. This is a complex but regular system that affects the majority of nouns and verbs.",

Stress falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable if that syllable is 'heavy' (contains a long vowel or ends in a consonant). If the penultimate syllable is 'light' (contains a short vowel and ends in a vowel), stress falls on the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable. This rule is exceptionless for words of three or more syllables and is critical for the language's rhythm. Another key process, especially in poetry, is elision, where a word-final vowel is omitted before a word that starts with a vowel or 'h'.",

"text": "In Old Norse, the most pervasive phonological rule is Umlaut (also called mutation). This is a process where a vowel in a word's stem changes to sound more like a vowel in its suffix. The two main types are I-umlaut (caused by an 'i' or 'j' in the suffix) and U-umlaut (caused by a 'u'). For example, the plural of 'bók' (book) is 'bœkr' because the original plural ending contained an 'i', which fronted the 'ó' to 'œ' before the ending itself changed.

Weak verbs, by contrast, form their past tense by adding a dental suffix (containing a 'd' or 't'), similar to English '-ed' (e.g., 'kalla' - to call, 'kallaði' - he called).
