1. Create a new project at 192kHz rate. Record with the highest available settings to achieve a near-to-real audio signal.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="square">
    <p>
2. These high-fidelity stems can either be used in a new project or you can change the project settings to 96kHz or even 48kHz. You are not losing fidelity by adjusting sample rates after recording.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="square">
    <p>
3. Render your mix in 192kHz, 32-bit. If the mix sounds too reverby or has other issues, adjust the mix, not the sample rate.
    </p>
  </div>  
  <div class="square">
    <p>
4. Open a fresh project at 192kHz, import the stereo mix, and add a mastering chain. Render the final master at 192kHz, 32-bit.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="square">
    <p>
5. (Optional) Remaster the high-fidelity master to a lower bitrate and depth as per the delivery method specs. This may involve dithering or using Adobe Media Encoder.

Yes, this seems like a good plan for achieving lossless audio production. It focuses on capturing the highest fidelity audio at the start and maintaining it through the mixing and mastering stages. A few points to highlight:

High Sample Rate Recording: Starting at 192kHz captures a very detailed audio signal, giving you flexibility later in the process. While 96kHz is also excellent, 192kHz is ideal if you want the absolute best starting point.
Bit Depth: 24-bit is a standard for professional audio and offers plenty of dynamic range. While 32-bit floating point can be helpful during processing, it's not necessary for the final product.
Maintaining High Resolution: Keeping your project at 192kHz until the very end ensures no data is lost during mixing and processing.
Analog Mastering: Running your mix through an analog rig adds a unique sonic character that many engineers appreciate.
Remastering for Delivery: This is an important step. Different platforms and formats have different requirements, so you may need to adjust your final master accordingly.
Additional Considerations:

Monitoring: Ensure your monitors and headphones are capable of reproducing the full frequency range of your high-resolution audio.
Storage: High-resolution audio files can be very large, so make sure you have enough storage space.
Plugin Compatibility: Check that your plugins can handle high sample rates without introducing artifacts.
Overall, this approach prioritizes audio quality and provides a solid framework for achieving lossless audio production.
