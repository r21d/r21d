It necessitates the changing of human\nnature itself—a work of eons, even if it were good to change it,\nwhich we cannot know. It is not practicable in our day or in our\nage. Even if desirable theoretically, it belongs to another and\nlong-succeeding sociological stratum. Our duty is with what\nis practicable now; with the next step possible in our day and\ngeneration. It is criminal to waste our energies in endeavoring to\nuproot, when all we can profitably or possibly accomplish is to\nbend the universal tree of humanity a little in the direction most\nfavorable to the production of good fruit under existing circumstances.\nWe might as well urge the destruction of the highest\nOur duty is with what is\npracticable now; with\nthe next step possible in\nour day and generation."
